# variable_scoping
Brief example of basic variable scoping within Pyhton

>This is to show how basic variable scoping works. In the code below, I provided a global varaible. An intiger, which can be called in any of the functions below it. 

>If a function is nested, it can only be called within the function in which it is defined. In this example, inner_fctn_2() can only be called within tbe base_fctn() definition block and inner_fctn_3() can only be called within the inner_fctn_2() definition block.

>This concept remains the same for declared variables. Functions may only reference functions that are declared inside that function, or that were declared in front of that function.
